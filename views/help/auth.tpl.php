<h3>About the login process</h3>

<p>
    When you sign up or log in, Clarity generates a unique, single use
    code and sends it to your email address as a form of verification.
</p>

<p>
    This code looks like an ordinary link.
    All you have to do is click on it to tell Clarity you are who you're
    supposed to be. Clarity then validates the code and logs you in.
</p>

<p>
    This way you don't even need a password!
