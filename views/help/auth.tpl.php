    <h3>About logging in</h3>

    <p>
        When you sign up or log in, Clarity generates a unique, single use
        code and sends it to your email address as a form of verification.
    </p>

    <p>
        This code looks like an ordinary link.
        All you have to do is click on it so that Clarity knows you're
        supposed to have access and lets you in.
    </p>

    <p>
        This way you can enjoy Clarity without 
        having to worry about yet another password.
        It's simpler and safer too.
    </p>
