<h3>About the login process</h3>

<p>
    When you try to login, Clarity asks for your email address and checks if an
    account exists for that address. Then it generates a unique, single use
    code and mails it to you.
</p>

<p>
    This code looks like an ordinary link.
    All you have to do is click on it.
    When you do, Clarity knows who you are and starts your user session.
</p>

<p>
    This way, Clarity doesn't need to ask your for a password.
    It's much safer, and more convenient as well.
